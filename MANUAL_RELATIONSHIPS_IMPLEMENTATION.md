# Manual Node Connection Curation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive system for manually curating connections between nodes in your Polkadot Ecosystem Map. This system allows you to define static relationships that are separate from the main data import workflow.

## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. **Relationship Configuration Files**
- **`public/relationships.yml`** - Main configuration file for manual relationships
- **`public/relationships.schema.yml`** - Schema definition for validation
- **`MANUAL_RELATIONSHIPS.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### 2. **Enhanced Type System**
- Added `ManualRelationship`, `RelationshipCategory`, `RelationshipType` interfaces
- Extended `EcosystemData` to include manual relationships
- Enhanced `GraphLink` to support relationship metadata
- Added `EnhancedRelationship` interface for unified relationship handling

### 3. **Data Service Integration**
- `fetchManualRelationships()` - Loads relationships.yml
- `processManualRelationships()` - Handles bidirectional relationships
- `mergeRelationships()` - Combines manual and entity relationships
- Automatic conflict resolution (manual relationships override entity ones)

### 4. **Graph Visualization Enhancements**
- Support for relationship filtering by type and category
- Visual styling based on relationship categories (colors, line styles)
- Enhanced link properties (weight, category, description)
- Separate toggles for manual vs entity relationships

### 5. **Configuration Options**
Updated `render.yaml` with new edge configuration options:
```yaml
edges:
  showManualRelationships: true
  showEntityRelationships: true
  styleByCategory: true
  styleByType: false
  relationshipTypes: []
  relationshipCategories: []
```

### 6. **Validation System**
- **`scripts/validate-relationships.ts`** - Comprehensive validation script
- Checks for required fields, proper formats, and data consistency
- Added npm script: `npm run validate-relationships`

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Relationship Types Supported**
- `partnership` - Strategic business partnerships
- `dependency` - Technical or operational dependencies
- `integration` - Product/service integrations
- `competitor` - Competing products/services
- `parent_child` - Hierarchical relationships
- `uses` - Service usage relationships
- Custom types can be easily added

### **Relationship Categories**
- `strategic` - Strategic partnerships (green, solid lines)
- `technical` - Technical dependencies (blue, dashed lines)
- `integration` - Product integrations (orange, dotted lines)
- `market` - Market relationships (purple, solid lines)

### **Advanced Features**
- **Bidirectional relationships** - Automatically create reverse connections
- **Weight-based styling** - Line thickness based on relationship strength
- **Category-based styling** - Colors and line styles per category
- **Metadata support** - Establishment dates, confidence levels, source URLs
- **Conflict resolution** - Manual relationships override entity relationships
- **Filtering** - Show/hide specific types or categories

## üìÅ File Structure

```
public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relationships.yml          # Main relationship definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relationships.schema.yml   # Schema for validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ render.yaml               # Updated with relationship options

scripts/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validate-relationships.ts  # Validation script

src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/types.ts            # Enhanced type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/dataService.ts   # Updated data loading
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/GraphView.tsx  # Enhanced graph visualization

MANUAL_RELATIONSHIPS.md       # Complete documentation
```

## üí° How to Use

### 1. **Define Relationships**
Edit `public/relationships.yml`:
```yaml
relationships:
  - source: "entity-a"
    target: "entity-b"
    type: "partnership"
    weight: 8
    description: "Strategic partnership"
    category: "strategic"
    bidirectional: true
```

### 2. **Validate Configuration**
```bash
npm run validate-relationships
```

### 3. **Configure Visualization**
Update `public/render.yaml` to control what relationships are shown and how they're styled.

### 4. **View Results**
Launch the application to see your curated relationships in the graph view.

## üé® Visual Styling

The system supports rich visual styling:

- **Line Width**: Based on relationship weight (1-10)
- **Line Color**: Based on category or relationship type
- **Line Style**: Solid, dashed, or dotted based on category
- **Manual vs Entity**: Different default colors to distinguish sources

## ‚úÖ Example Relationships

I've included sample relationships between actual entities in your data:
- Astar/Shiden ‚Üî Deeper Network (partnership)
- Astar/Shiden ‚Üí Polkadot Core (dependency)
- Deeper Network ‚Üí Astar/Shiden (integration)
- Astar/Shiden ‚Üî Moonbeam/Moonriver (competition)

## üîß Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Manual relationships are separate from data import
2. **Static Configuration**: Relationships persist independently of imported data
3. **Rich Metadata**: Support for descriptions, confidence levels, source URLs
4. **Visual Flexibility**: Comprehensive styling and filtering options
5. **Validation**: Built-in validation prevents configuration errors
6. **Documentation**: Complete documentation and examples
7. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new relationship types and categories

## üö¶ Next Steps

To start using the system:

1. **Review the example relationships** in `relationships.yml`
2. **Read the documentation** in `MANUAL_RELATIONSHIPS.md`
3. **Add your own relationships** based on your domain knowledge
4. **Configure visualization** in `render.yaml` to match your preferences
5. **Validate regularly** using `npm run validate-relationships`

The system is fully functional and ready for production use. You can now curate rich, meaningful connections between entities in your ecosystem map that go beyond what can be automatically imported from external data sources.
